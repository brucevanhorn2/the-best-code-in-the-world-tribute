# the-best-code-in-the-world-tribute
## A parody of "The Best Song in the World" by TenaciousD.
This is the greatest and best code in the world.
Tribute.

Long time ago me and my brothers Ben and Henry here:
We was zoomin' workin' some long and gnarly code.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny daemon coming at us through Node
And he said,

"Write me the best code in the world, or I'll eat your soul."

I looked at Henry and Ben, and we each said, "Okay."

And we coded the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be
The best code in the world,
It was the best code in the world.

Look at my IDE and it's easy to see
One and one make ten, ten and one make eleven,
It's np-complete.

Once every hundred pull requests or so,
When the bytes doth shine and the bits doth glow,
And market share doth grow.

Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
A whip-crack went his whippy tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us, "Be you angels?"
And we said, "Nay. We are but nerds."
Rock!

This is not the greatest code in the world, no.
This is just a tribute.
We didn't commit the best code in the world, no.
This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest code in the world, alright!
It was the greatest code in the world, alright!
It was the best gitforking code, the greatest code in the world. Alright!

[Skat]

And the peculiar thing is this, my friends:
The code we wrote on that fateful night: it didn't actually work anything like in this song.

This is just a tribute!
You can't even fork it!
And I wish we had pushed it!
Or even logged into github.

Ah, fork! Good God, God lovin',
So surprised to find you can't stop it.
A fiery ring of fire,
Rich motherforker
Alright! Alright!
